# Hive Data Analysis - Employees & Departments

## **Project Overview**
This project involves analyzing employee and department data using Apache Hive. The goal is to efficiently store, query, and extract insights from the datasets by leveraging Hiveâ€™s partitioning and querying capabilities. Additionally, we will export results for further analysis.

---

## **Datasets Used**

### **1. Employees Dataset (employees.csv)**
This dataset contains employee-related information such as job role, salary, department, and project assignment.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| emp_id | Unique identifier for the employee |
| name | Full name of the employee |
| age | Age of the employee |
| job_role | Designation/job title of the employee |
| salary | Annual salary of the employee |
| project | Assigned project (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omega) |
| join_date | Employee's joining date |
| department | The department the employee belongs to (used for partitioning) |

### **2. Departments Dataset (departments.csv)**
This dataset provides information on company departments.

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| dept_id | Unique identifier for the department |
| department_name | Name of the department |
| location | Location of the department |

## **Steps to Load Data into Hive**

### **Step 1: Upload CSV Files to HDFS**
```sh
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse/data
hdfs dfs -put employees.csv /user/hive/warehouse/data/
hdfs dfs -put departments.csv /user/hive/warehouse/data/
```

### **Step 2: Create Hive Tables**
#### **Creating a Temporary Table for Employees**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees_temp (
    emp_id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    job_role STRING,
    salary DOUBLE,
    project STRING,
    join_date STRING,
    department STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```
#### **Load Data into Temporary Table**
```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/data/employees.csv' INTO TABLE employees_temp;
```

#### **Create a Partitioned Table for Employees**
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT,
    name STRING,
    age INT,
    job_role STRING,
    salary DOUBLE,
    project STRING,
    join_date STRING
)
PARTITIONED BY (department STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS PARQUET;
```
#### **Insert Data into Partitioned Table**
```sql
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition = true;
SET hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode = nonstrict;

INSERT INTO TABLE employees PARTITION (department)
SELECT emp_id, name, age, job_role, salary, project, join_date, department FROM employees_temp;
```

#### **Create the Departments Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id INT,
    department_name STRING,
    location STRING
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```
#### **Load Data into Departments Table**
```sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/hive/warehouse/data/departments.csv' INTO TABLE departments;
```

## **Hive Queries and Sample Outputs**

### **1. List Employees Who Joined After 2015**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE year(TO_DATE(join_date, 'yyyy-MM-dd')) > 2015;
```
**Sample Output:**
| emp_id | name | age | job_role | salary | project | join_date | department |
|--------|------|-----|----------|--------|---------|-----------|------------|
| 201 | John | 28 | Developer | 80000 | Alpha | 2017-05-12 | IT |

---

### **2. Compute Average Salary by Department**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```
**Sample Output:**
| department | avg_salary |
|------------|------------|
| Finance | 90000 |
| Sales | 65000 |

---

### **3. Employees Assigned to 'Alpha' Project**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE project = 'Alpha';
```

---

### **4. Employee Count by Job Role**
```sql
SELECT job_role, COUNT(*) AS employee_count FROM employees GROUP BY job_role;
```

---

### **5. Employees with Salary Above Department Average**
```sql
SELECT e.* FROM employees e
JOIN (
    SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department
) dept_avg
ON e.department = dept_avg.department
WHERE e.salary > dept_avg.avg_salary;
```

---

### **6. Department with Maximum Employees**
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

---

### **7. Exclude Employees with Missing Data**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE emp_id IS NOT NULL
AND name IS NOT NULL
AND age IS NOT NULL
AND job_role IS NOT NULL
AND salary IS NOT NULL
AND project IS NOT NULL
AND join_date IS NOT NULL
AND department IS NOT NULL;
```

---

### **8. Join Employees with Departments for Location Info**
```sql
SELECT e.*, d.location
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department = d.department_name;
```

---

### **9. Rank Employees by Salary in Each Department**
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, department, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

---

### **10. Retrieve Top 3 Highest Paid Employees Per Department**
```sql
SELECT emp_id, name, department, salary, salary_rank
FROM (
    SELECT emp_id, name, department, salary,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employees
) ranked
WHERE salary_rank <= 3;
```

## **Exporting Query Results in Hue**
### **Manual Export**
1. Run a query in Hue.
2. Click on the **Export** button in the results.
3. Choose **CSV, Excel, or JSON** and download the file.

### **Automated Export to HDFS**
```sql
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/hive/output/avg_salary'
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```
To view the output:
```sh
hdfs dfs -cat /user/hive/output/avg_salary/*
```

---

## **Conclusion**
This project effectively utilizes Apache Hive for large-scale employee and department data analysis. By partitioning data and exporting query results, we enhance efficiency and ensure valuable insights.
